46,"Press down hard on the gas
 That’s right, there’s no compromise
 We'll slip through the night
 At the final moment push hard
 That's right, all the way to zero,
 Until we wipe away the days
 Gently open your heart
 If you pull it close to you
 It will reach you, without a doubt
 It will come, closer
 Now
 We’re speeding through life, squeezing it for all of its worth
 Our feet are tied
 But we still keep going farther
 Even if I take it back, and grasp it
 If you’re not the one
 There will be no meaning
 And so we’ll go far off into the distance.
 I’m going to be Hokage!
 I won’t lose here!
 Whatever! You can’t keep up with my speed at all!
 U-!
 Zu-! Ma-! Ki-!
 Naruto Barrage!
 The winner is Naruto Uzumaki.
 I’m…getting stronger!
 Ohhhh!
 Cha!
 Nice one! You did it!
 T-That Naruto beat Kiba!
 It’s a major upset…
 Yup!
 Yes!
 Byakugan Battle: Hinata Grows Bold!
 This medicine works really well!
 Here! Do you want to use it too, Sakura?
 Only your wounds heal with such speed…Naruto.
 The power of Nine Tail never cease to amaze me.
 U-Umm...
 T-This is…
 ointment for your wound,
 for you Kiba and Akamaru.
 Rather than worrying about others,
 it’s about time you worried about yourself!
 Kiba…
 There are only 6 people left…
 you, Choji, Neji, Lee, one Sound guy, and the Sand guy.
 Listen, Hinata…
 If you pull that guy from Sand, withdraw quickly.
 And there’s one more…
 Do the same if you get Neji, too.
 Withdraw quickly…
 That guy will be hard on you.
 He will destroy you.
 Well, let’s announce the next match.
 – Huh? 					– Huh?
 – What? 					– Huh?
 Hinata Hyuga vs. Neji Hyuga
 Hinata…
 This is going to be an interesting match…
 I never thought that I would have a fight with you…
 Lady Hinata.
 Brother Neji…
 Brother?
 Huh?!
 Those two are siblings?
 They’re descended from
 one of the most honorable old families in the Hidden Leaf…
 The Hyuga Clan.
 But, they’re not siblings.
 Then, how are they related?
 Well, the relation of a head family and branch family…
 That may be an appropriate way to say it.
 Head family and branch family?
 Yes!
 Hinata is from the head family.
 In other words, a person from the main household
 and Neji is from a branch family that is descended from that family.
 In other words, it’s a fight between relatives.
 It must be uneasy for both of them…
 Yes.
 However…
 Huh? What is it?
 I’ve heard that from long ago,
 there’ve been various incidents between the head family and branch family,
 and now their relationship isn’t on very good terms.
 Hmmm.
 Why?
 I don’t know the details either.
 Only…
 The so-called distinguished Ninja clans like Uchiha and Hyuga
 have special techniques and abilities that run in the family.
 It seems that the Hyuga household laid down rules
 for communicating those techniques…
 It seems that there are many rules that favor the head family…
 – Huh? 					– Huh?
 And there have been various incidents
 between the head family and branch family due to those rules.
 So this is a confrontation billed as a clash of fate…
 Oh, it’s gonna begin.
 Start the battle please!
 Just one thing before we square off against each other in the fight…
 I should advise you, Lady Hinata.
 Withdraw!
 You’re not suited to being a Shinobi.
 You’re too nice.
 You wish for harmony and avoid conflict,
 you’re open to going with the thinking of others.
 And, you have no confidence in yourself.
 You’re always feeling inferior…
 You thought it’s a good idea to stay Genin.
 However, you can’t register for the Chunin test without three members…
 So you couldn’t turn down when Kiba and the other proposed it and,
 the truth is, you entered the exam reluctantly.
 Is that wrong?!
 T-That’s wrong…
 That’s not true…
 I…
 I only…
 I wanted to change that about myself…
 So I proposed it myself…
 Hinata…
 Stand up, Hanabi!
 From now on, I’ll keep Hinata under my wing…
 But is that really okay?
 Hinata should be the heir to the Hyuga clan…
 But, there is always death involved with the job of Genin.
 Do what you want.
 She’s a failure who’s inferior even to her younger sister Hanabi, five years her junior.
 We don’t need her here in Hyuga clan…
 Is that all you have to say?
 If so, leave!
 You’re in the way!
 Yes.
 Hinata is trying to change herself in her own way.
 Lady Hinata…
 You are a spoiled one of the head family.
 People can never change!
 A failure will always be a failure…
 That personality and strength won’t change.
 That guy…
 Since people don’t change, differences exist among them…
 and expressions like “elite” and “failure” are born.
 Everyone judges and are judged
 based on the value of their face and brain, ability and body type,
 good and bad points of their personalities.
 People have to suffer and live
 within the means of the elements they cannot change.
 Just like the fact that I’m from a branch family
 and you’re from the head family,
 these things can’t change.
 I’ve seen everything with this Byakugan.
 That’s why I understand!
 You’re just talking tough.
 You’re really thinking that you’d like to run away from this place…
 T-That’s wrong…
 I really…
 Byakugan?
 It’s said that if you trace the Uchiha Clan’s history,
 the clan’s ability has its source in Hyuga clan.
 The Byakugan is one of the Hyuga clan’s Kekkei Genkai,
 a Visual Jutsu similar to Sharingan…
 However, with the ability of insight alone…
 it gets the better of Sharingan.
 Byakugan!
 Hinata Hyuga vs. Neji Hyuga
 My eyes can’t be deceived.
 Just now from my pressure,
 your line of sight was pushed to the upper left.
 This is the sign that you're recalling your past experience…
 your bitter past.
 And soon after that, your line of sight moved to the bottom right…
 This is the sign that you're imagining physical and mental suffering.
 That means…
 you’re picturing your old self,
 and from all of your experiences up until now,
 you’re imagining the result of this battle…
 The image of you losing!
 Even the act of propping your arms in front of your body…
 It’s a gesture that means
 you want to build a wall between us and keep distant.
 And that reflects your mind...
 that you don’t want any more of your deepest feelings to be raided…
 Because everything I’ve said is right on the mark, right?
 Furthermore…
 Laying a finger on your lips,
 that too, is a self-familiarizing act which represents a sense of panic.
 It represents a defense instinct--
 you want to alleviate the tension and unease.
 In other words…
 deep in your heart, you know it’s true, don’t you?
 Changing yourself, is something you absolutely can’t--!
 Sure, she can!
 You don’t have the privilege of deciding what a person is like, stupid!
 Give it to him, Hinata!
 Naruto…
 Hinata!
 Don’t just take it! Argue back!
 I’m getting irritated watching this!
 Naruto…
 What an annoying guy!
 Naruto…
 Thank you!
 The expression of her eyes has changed…
 So you’re not going to withdraw?
 I ‘m not taking responsibility for what happens!
 I…
 I won’t run away!
 I don’t…
 I don’t change my words…
 That’s my Way of Ninja!
 ...want to run anymore!
 Byakugan!
 Brother Neji!
 I challenge you!
 T-That is…
 Fine…
 Of course, the same Hyuga style…
 Her pose is very similar to Neji’s.
 Hyuga style?
 The strongest Taijutsu style in the Village Hidden in the Leaf…
 Huh?
 I said it before...
 The man who is most likely
 the strongest Genin of Hidden Leaf Village is on my team…
 That’s…
 That guy, Neji Hyuga.
 Here!
 Did it go in?!
 No…it was shallow!
 No. Even a graze works.
 That’s the reason that the Hyuga clan
 is called the Hidden Leaf’s distinguished family.
 Huh? What do you mean?
 The Hyuga has a particular Taijutsu passed down through generations.
 It’s not like the kind of Taijutsu that Lee and I are good at…
 Our way of fighting, Furious Fist,
 is mainly to inflict external damage on our enemy,
 like broken bones and surface wounds.
 In contrast, the Hyuga’s Taijutsu inflict damage
 on the Chakra Network through which Chakra flow through the body,
 and damaging the insides, namely, it destroys internal organs.
 They possess the Gentle Fist.
 It’s not spectacular to watch…
 but later it slowly takes effect.
 Well, you can’t train the internal organs…
 Even if you were really robust,
 one hit from it would be a deadly blow…
 Even I can…
 Hinata’s on the offensive…
 Hinata…
 Way to go, Hinata!
 To attack the Chakra Network…
 What are they, those people…?
 Hey!
 Hey!
 Chakra Network, what’s that?!
 Here we go again…
 a question from a stupid guy.
 I’ll explain.
 They’re like blood canals.
 In the same way that blood flows through vessels throughout the body,
 They’re bundles of canals that take Chakra’s into every corner of your body…
 Oh!
 Like a path for Chakras, huh?
 Yes…
 Furthermore, the Chakra Network is closely connected
 with the internal organs which enfold Chakra within the body.
 That’s why if the Chakra Network is attacked
 the internal organs also suffer damage.
 Huh, you know a lot, don’t 'ya?
 Hey you! That's no way to talk to your senior!
 It’s no wonder…
 Lee’s greatest long-standing enemy.
 That’s…
 him.
 Sensei…
 But, how can they do that?
 After all, the Chakra Network isn’t visible to the eyes.
 How do they attack the Chakra line inside the body?
 No.
 The eyes of those two…
 They can see it with their Byakugan.
 And a Gentle Fist attack is a little different from a regular attack.
 They release their own Chakra
 from a Chakra opening in their hand and screw it into their opponent’s body.
 It directly inflicts damage on your enemy’s Chakra Network.
 All right!
 Has she done it?
 Hey, can you hear it?
 The clear, blue sky goes on and on
 The ocean spans limitlessly
 Please keep that smile on your face forever
 Or else I’ll cry
 You won't have to search around you
 It’s all ok now.
 Everyone is inside this hand
 when you want to cry, and you want to run away
 When you forget what happiness is
 Just sing.
 Light is born, and darkness was born
 The two are one
 Harmonia, feel the telepathy
 Hey, can you hear it?
 Amazing!
 That Hinata!
 She’s always melancholy and wishy-washy and…
 I thought she is kinda weird, yet…
 Even when she gets blow after blow, she gets back up and goes.
 There’s something about her way of fighting.
 Just a feeling, but she resembles you, I think.
 Resembles me? Hinata resembles me?
 Now that I think about it, that girl, she was always watching you.
 Huh?

 Hinata, fight!

 Sasuke's Decision: Pushed to the Edge!
 There you are!
 I’m here!
 I’m returning them to you!
 So it’s a clone…
 Bastard!
 Sasuke…Uchiha…!
 Why won’t you come at me?!
 Why…
 do you flee?!
 Ready?
 Over here!
 Over here!
 Wait!
 Pass!
 Here! Good one!
 Good! Go! Go! Go!
 Power shot!
 What’re we gonna do?
 We don’t know any wall-climbing techniques or anything…
 Y-You’re…
 This…
 It’s Gaara…
 Gaara of Sand…
 R-Run!
 Wait!
 Don’t leave me alone!
 Help me!
 I don't…
 want to be alone anymore!
 Really…
 No!
 Gaara! Please calm down!
 Yashamaru…
 No escape!
 I won’t let you escape! Sasuke Uchiha!
 You’ve gotta be kidding! What’s with that outrageous strength…?
 Are you afraid of me?
 It’s too overwhelming…
 Sasuke Uchiha! Are you afraid? Are you afraid of my existence?!
 Don’t forget… You are my prey.
 Wait!
 Why are you fixated on me so much?
 Those eyes that know true loneliness…
 And eyes that know that it is the world’s greatest suffering…
 I think I told you.
 That you have the same eyes as me.
 Eyes that lust for power,
 overflowing with hatred and murderous intent…
 The same as me…
 Eyes that burn to kill those who drove you…
 into a hell called loneliness!
 Such are your eyes.
 Okay. Just a minute.
 So you’re called Gaara…
 I don’t know what you know about Sasuke, but…
 It’s not good for you to speak as though
 you perceive everything about Sasuke!
 What is it that you want to say to him before the final round,
 by pursuing him so far?
 A battle is where…
 another’s existence and one’s own existence are put on the line…
 and each tries to kill the other!
 Only the winner can actually feel the value of his own existence.
 In other words, what you want to say is…
 let’s have a killing bout and not a match?
 Uchiha… You really should be wanting it, too…
 in the depths of your soul…
 You want to confirm the value of your existence.
 Am I really, truly powerful?
 Is my existence more powerful than my opponent
 who faces me with eyes filled with intent to kill?
 What’s the matter?!
 Sasuke Uchiha!
 Are you afraid of me?!
 Your hatred and intent to kill…
 have they given way to fear?
 Is that the extent of your existence?!
 Fight me…and confirm it!
 Your value! Your existence!
 Experience it!
 If you want an answer…
 Come at me!
 I was allowed to live…
 Only…myself.
 Expressly for what reason?!
 No… I know the reason.
 The reason that man left me alive was so he wouldn’t be tormented
 by a sense of guilt for having killed an entire clan…
 Itachi chose me as the avenger… in order to have me kill him!
 Now, let me have some fun… Sasuke Uchiha!
 I’ll finish it with one blow!
 Hurry up and die, release yourself from your misery.
 You silly old fool…
 I believe I told you… that you would die too!
 Bastard!
 Let go, you old fool!
 I will not let go! I refuse to let go…
 until I have pulled out your soul!
 At this rate…
 Gaara!
 Looks like it worked…
 I see! That’s what it was!
 That’s not possible…
 He countered Gaara’s attack in that condition?!
 I just realized the reason… why it’s so fun!
 This pain…
 To take down an opponent who wounded me…
 and thoroughly destroy him…!
 That will make me truly feel alive!
 Gaara’s never had a single wound, but he got Gaara twice.
 Is he…a freak?!
 No…a true freak is…
 After all, the only thing Gaara is transforming is still just his right arm.
 More, more!
 What?!
 What the heck is this guy?!
 One after another…
 Here goes!
 He’s even faster!
 I can’t dodge unless I read ahead of his movements.
 If I didn’t have these eyes I’d have died long ago.
 I can no longer use Chidori…
 Fire Style… Fire Ball Jutsu!
 So the Fire Style doesn’t work against sand…
 Not only that, this level of Jutsu won’t…
 Die!
 Apparently…it needs to be Chidori!
 Well! Your limit is two shots. That’s about it…
 This is as many Chidori you can shoot in one day
 with your present Chakra.
 After all, this Chidori is a technique that can only be used
 in conjunction with Sharingan during actual battles.
 But using Sharingan and another Jutsu simultaneously means
 exploding and using up the Chakra in your body all at once.
 Well! But you really are one of the more impressive ones.
 Even with my Chidori…
 If I use the Lightning Blade four times in a day,
 I’d completely use up my Chakra.
 What would happen if I tried to use more than two shots?
 The third shot won’t be activated…
 Remember this well!
 If you try to force a Jutsu to activate…
 not only will the Jutsu not properly activate,
 but your Chakra will deplete to zero…
 And in the worst case, you’ll die!
 Even if you were to survive, absolutely nothing good will come of it.
 Especially in your case.
 What's the matter?
 Does the value of your existence amount to only this much?
 I’ll be blunt…
 You are…weak!
 You’re too optimistic.
 And it’s because your hatred is weak!
 The power of hatred is the power of the intent to kill!
 The power of the intent to kill is the power of revenge!
 Your hatred is weaker than mine!
 Shut up…
 Do you understand the meaning of this?!
 Shut up!
 That means that you… You are weaker than me!
 Itachi chose me to be the avenger… to have me kill him!
 I am an avenger!
 The Curse Mark again…
 Darn…! My body…
 Sasuke!
 Everyone makes mistakes lt’s nothing to be ashamed about
 Don’t let this scar be for naught Walk with a smile
 Yes, breathe in the air Lift your face to the sky and jump
 If it rains, take a break Go where the wind takes you
 So many regrets Don’t let this scar be for naught
 Let’s go carve the badges in our chest Yes, it’s Show Time, life begins now.
 Everyone makes mistakes  It’s nothing to be ashamed about
 Don’t let this scar be for naught Walk with a smile
 Transform sadness into the wind and continue to forge on
 Forge on strong
 Hey Yashamaru, what does pain feel like?
 I don’t know because I’ve never been injured…
 I was wondering what it’s like.
 Could it be that I’m hurt?
 I’m not bleeding, but my chest’s felt weird for a long time.
 It feels stifled and it hurts a lot!
